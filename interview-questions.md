# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: the values that are within the function, when called are arguments. The actual value of the variable that gets passed to the function. a parameter is are variables that are defined when fuction is declared. 

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters. 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:  .map() returns an array, of which, all elements contained are the result of the element in the same index position from the previous array, being passed through callback funtion.

Researched answer: map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. map() calls a function once for each element in an array. map() does not execute the function for empty elements.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map creates a new array by changing each individual element in an array. filter creates a new array by removing unneeded elements. 

Researched answer: They both return a new array. map returns a new array of elements where a function has been invoked on the element to change the original element. filter returns a new array of the elements of the original array. filter will only return elements when the function invoked returns a boolean of true for each element passed to the function.



4. What is the DOM?

Your answer: Document object model. data representation of the objects that contains the formation and contents of a online document.

Researched answer: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

5. What is React? Why would you use it?

Your answer: React is a JS library, that uses markup and js simoultaneously, created by facebook. It enables coders to make faster UI for websites and apps. React should be used because it is flexible and can be used on multiple platforms to build UI..

Researched answer: React is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. It  is used to handle the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. React enables developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: JS hoisting is when function declarations, variables, or classes are moved to the top of their scope before the function is invoked.

Researched answer: Hoisting is when a function or a variable can be used before declaration. For example, // using test before declaring console.log(test); // undefined var test; Run Code. the output will be undefined .

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: A user story is a format for framing software features and/or requirements. As the “user” part suggests, user stories are written in first person singular and describe a feature as it is perceived by the app’s user

2. Spread operator: The JavaScript spread operator allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React props: Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. props stands for properties.

4. Conditional rendering:  In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application. Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.

5. DOM events: DOM events allow JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document. Events are normally used in combination with functions, and the function will not be executed before the event occurs (such as when a user clicks a button).
